Steps to Create a To-Do List in Python:
Initialize the list: Start by creating an empty list that will store all the tasks.

Create functions: These functions will handle the core operations like adding tasks, viewing tasks, and removing tasks.

Main loop: Create a loop that will keep running, allowing the user to interact with the list until they decide to quit.
How It Works:
todo_list: An empty list that holds tasks.
add_task(): A function that adds a task to the list.
view_tasks(): A function that displays all the tasks with numbering.
remove_task(): A function that removes a task based on the task number entered by the user.
Main loop: A loop that repeatedly shows the options, lets users choose actions, and updates the to-do list until they choose to quit.
Extensions
File handling: You can save the list to a file so that tasks persist after the program is closed.
Error handling: Add checks to ensure the user enters valid input.
Graphical Interface: Use libraries like Tkinter to create a graphical version of the to-do list.
